# Sudoku Solver

This Python project implements an automated Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm. The program takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and fills in the missing numbers to solve the puzzle. The solution is output in a readable format, showcasing the completed board.

## Features
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Utilizes a depth-first search approach to explore potential solutions and backtrack when encountering invalid configurations.
- **Validation**: Checks for the validity of numbers based on Sudoku rules: no duplicate numbers in rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids.
- **Readable Output**: Provides a clear and formatted display of the Sudoku grid before and after solving.

## Usage
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python sudoku_solver.py
